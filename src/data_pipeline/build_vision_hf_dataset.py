"""Assemble the reviewed tablet crops into a proper HF `datasets.Dataset`
(one row per unique tablet, not per text line) and save it locally.

Deliberately NOT one row per line of the main text dataset (which has
tablet_id but is line-granular, ~604k rows): a photo belongs to a tablet,
not to any one of its lines, and a table can have anywhere from 1 to dozens
of lines. Embedding the same image bytes into every line-row of a tablet
would multiply storage for no reason and doesn't match how train_mbert.py
actually consumes it (a tablet_id -> image lookup, joined at collate time).
This is that same join, materialized as its own compact table: one row per
reviewed tablet id, ready to publish as a separate HF dataset config
("vision") alongside the existing line-level "default" config, joinable by
tablet_id.

Split into train/val/test matching the SAME tablet-level assignment as
data/processed/hf_dataset's line-level splits (not a fresh random split of
just the image subset) -- a tablet's photo and its own text lines must
stay on the same side of the split, same as any other tablet-grouped data,
and this keeps the vision config directly comparable to (and joinable
with) the text config's val/test rather than an independently-drawn subset.

Output: data/processed/hf_dataset_vision/ (DatasetDict via save_to_disk,
splits train/validation/test)
  columns: tablet_id, image, x1, y1, x2, y2 (bbox in the ORIGINAL image's
  pixel space, not the saved crop's), period, genre, provenience, language
  (this project's canonical mapped labels, "Unknown" if the raw CDLI field
  didn't map to a known class -- see prepare_hf_dataset.py's map_* functions).
